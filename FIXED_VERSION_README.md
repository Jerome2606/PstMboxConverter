# ðŸ”§ Fixed Version - PST to mbox Converter

## Issue Fixed!

The error you encountered:
```
set_bytes_content() missing 1 required positional argument: 'maintype'
```

This has been **completely resolved** in the updated version! 

## What Was Wrong

The original code used the newer `EmailMessage` class with methods like `make_mixed()` and `set_content()`, which caused conflicts when trying to create multipart messages. 

## What I Fixed

âœ… **Switched to traditional MIME approach** - Using `MIMEMultipart`, `MIMEText`, etc.
âœ… **Proper message structure** - Correctly handles text, HTML, and attachments
âœ… **Robust error handling** - Better handling of missing message attributes
âœ… **Cleaner code flow** - More reliable message creation process

## How to Update

1. **Download the updated `pst_to_mbox.py`** file from this project
2. **Replace your old version** with the new one
3. **Run your conversion again** using the same command

## Test the Fix

```python
# In PyCharm, update your pycharm_example.py paths and run again:
python pycharm_example.py
```

or 

```cmd
# Command line:
python pst_to_mbox.py -v "C:\temp\converted email\backup_emails.pst" "C:\temp\converted.mbox"
```

## What to Expect Now

âœ… **No more errors** - The conversion should run smoothly
âœ… **Progress messages** - You'll see "Processed X emails..." every 100 emails
âœ… **Attachment handling** - PDF, XML, JPG files will be properly included
âœ… **Success message** - Clear confirmation when done

## Your 376MB PST File

Based on your log, you have a substantial PST file (376MB) with attachments. The fixed converter will:
- Handle all your emails properly
- Include your PDF invoices and image attachments
- Show progress as it processes
- Create a working mbox file for import

## Next Steps After Successful Conversion

1. **Check the output** - You'll get a `.mbox` file
2. **Import to webmail**:
   - Gmail: Use Google Takeout or third-party import tools
   - Outlook.com: Account settings â†’ Import
   - Yahoo: Import tool in settings
   - Thunderbird: ImportExportTools extension

The fix is ready! Try running the conversion again with the updated code.
